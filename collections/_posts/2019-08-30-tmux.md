`Terminal multiplexer` is a software that can multiplex several separate pseudoterminal-based login sessions inside one terminal. 

Main features:

1. **Persistence** - similar to `nohup`, permits to deconnect and reconnect without terminating runned processes
2. **Multiple windows** - split-sceens, several windows to have several terminals on one screen.
3. **Session sharing** - multiple users can connect to the same session.


Let's consider one popular **T**erminal **Mu**lteple**x**er - `tmux`.

## Installation

`sudo apt-get install tmux`

## Basic abstractions

* Session - aggregate and controls a number of terminals and processes
* Window - can be split into several `panes`, session can have multiple windows.
* Pane - `window` can be devided into `panes`
* Control key - every control command will look like  `*PREFIX KEY* + *COMMAND KEY*` where `PREFIX KEY` is `Ctrl+B` by default. In this tutorial I will use `C-b` instead of `Ctrl+B`

## Basic functionalities

Here are some basic functionalities:

* when ssh is disconnected session will persist
* sessions for different tasks
* connect to the shell of different user


## Panes

`C-b`  + `%`   =  split left/right

`C-b`  + `"`  =  split up / down

`C-b` + `left/right`  = go to prev/next pane

`exit`  or `C-d`  = close pane

## Windows

`C-b` + `c`  = new window

`C-b` + `p/n`  = go to prev/next window

`C-b` + `<number>` = go to window `<number>`

## Sessions

`C-b` + `d`   = detach session

`tmux ls`  = list of sessions

`tmux attach -t 0`  = attach to session 0

`tmux new -s database` = create session named "database"


## Mouse control

{% highlight bash %}
# Enable mouse control (clickable windows, panes, resizable panes)
set -g mouse-select-window on
set -g mouse-select-pane on
set -g mouse-resize-pane on

# Enable mouse mode (tmux 2.1 and above)
set -g mouse on
{% endhighlight %}


## Shared sessions 

`tmux` can also create `shared sessions` and different users can attach to this sessions at the same time.


Create 
{% highlight bash %}
tmux -S /tmp/socket_name new -s session_name
{% endhighlight%}

Modify socket permissions to get access for other users in group `tmux`
{% highlight bash %}
chgrp tmux /tmp/socket_name
{% endhighlight %}

Attach
{% highlight bash %}
tmux -S /tmp/socket_name attach -t session_name
{% endhighlight%}

Attach Read-only
{% highlight bash %}
tmux -S /tmp/socket_name attach -t session_name -r
{% endhighlight%}

? Problem: two users connected to shared session will use the same session. Active pane and windows is connected to the session, so they won't be able to look at different windows at the same time, and type in different panes simultaneously.

! Solution: `grouped sessions`

## Grouped sessions

`grouped sessions` allow to share windows and panes between sessions and work in different windows and panes. 

{% highlight bash %}
tmux new-session -s grouped_session
{% endhighlight%}

{% highlight bash %}
tmux new-session -t grouped_session -s group_subsession
{% endhighlight%}

## Usage optimized

Here we will discuss some configurations and best practicise to foster usage of tmux and make it more transparent and easier

### Some hack to organize multiuser interaction with shared sessions

Shared sessions is implemented with unix sockets, and there is no functionality to look at all shared sessions.
To organize shared sessions on the server for a small team we can do the following:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo adgroup tmux 

sudo usermod -a -G tmux <USERS>  
sudo mkdir - mode=u+rwx,g+rws,o-rwx /var/tmux_sessions
sudo chown user:tmux /var/tmux_sessions
{% endhighlight%}

Where `<USERS>` means add all necessary users manually or list all users with other util.

Then we can add some sh-sctips to `start`, `attach` and `list` shared sessions.

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh
SESSION_NAME=$1
tmux -S /var/tmux_sessions/$SESSION_NAME attach -t $SESSION_NAME
#!/bin/bash
ls -l /var/tmux_sessions/ | grep ^s | awk '{print substr($9, 1, length($9)-1) " (" $3 ")" }'
#!/bin/sh
SESSION_NAME=$1
tmux -S /var/tmux_sessions/$SESSION_NAME new -s $SESSION_NAME
chgrp tmux /var/tmux_sessions/$SESSION_NAME
{% endhighlight%}
