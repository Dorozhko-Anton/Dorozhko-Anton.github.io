    4.  python api to add models
    5.  no hotkeys ?
    6.  dockerized

    2.  Drawing bounding box, polygon, cubic bezier, line and point
    3.  Label pixels with brush and superpixel tools
    4.  Export to the YOLO, KITTI, COCO JSON, and CSV format
    5.  Automatically label images using Core ML model
    6.  Auto-suggest speeds up selecting the object name
    7.  1-click buttons make your labeling work faster
    8.  Settings for objects, attributes, hotkeys, and labeling fast
    9.  Convert video to image frames
17. LabelBox https://github.com/labelbox/labelbox/  https://labelbox.com/
    1. SaaS https://app.labelbox.com/projects
    2. JS, python (for interfaces)
    3. polygons, class hotkeys, skip, submit, 
    4. can't move the polygon
    5. zoom

20. SMART https://rtiinternational.github.io/SMART/  (RECOMMENDED)
    1.  active learning
    2.  admin dashboard
    3.  multi user
    4.  open source
    5.  on premise
    6.  Default Text classification (Is it easy to add object detection ?)
    7.  Adding features doesn't save page state, long, can't use enter,
    8.  DATASET AND LABELS ARE CONNECTED (manual check, remake all steps for setup a project) (WHY NOT LOAD LABEL SCHEMA)
    9.  You cannot update the labels for a project after the project is created.
    10.

# Startups 

## [Scale](https://scale.com/) 

Scale is the Data Platform for AI. 

![scale_services](/assets/images/wintics_series/scale_products.png){: .center-image }

We are mostly interesting in `2D Boxes` annotations for now. 
Scale proposes a price of `$0.08 / Image + $0.08 / Annotation` 

Let's make a rough calculation. If we want 200 images with on average 6 objects it will cost us :
200*0.08 * (1 + 6) =  112 $

For denser images, say with 50 images on average:
200*0.08 * (1 + 50) =  816 $

For simple 2D Box cases it might be costly, but they have a lot more different types of tasks. And segmentation with 6.4$ by image is quite good. Radar and Lidar point clouds require good tools to make labelisation faster, as well as video annotations and Sensor fusions, so the added value of that company is great.  

TODO: add simple js calculations with slider 

You create a task with instructions and examples as a request to scale API and labeller will do it. [API docs](https://scale.com/docs#create-computer-vision-tasks)



## [DBrain](https://dbrain.io/)

Same as Scale but it is only ready to propose you a demo. 

## [Hasty](https://hasty.ai)

Create Project -> Access rules -> Manual annotation examples -> Start to receive AI support (when model is ready) -> Manual Review Tool 

2D Bbox
Polygon
Countour (with countour detection)
MagicWand (segmentation)
Brush (segmentation)
Grabcut (segmentation in the selection, with cut brush)

Classifier of the selection 
Object-detection assistant (prelabelisation)
